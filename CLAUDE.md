When devenv.nix doesn't exist and a command/tool is missing, create ad-hoc environment:

    $ devenv -O languages.rust.enable:bool true -O packages:pkgs "mypackage mypackage2" shell -- cli args

When the setup is becomes complex create `devenv.nix` and run commands within:

    $ devenv shell -- cli args
