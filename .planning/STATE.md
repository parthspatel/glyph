## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-04 | Manual advance after submit | Show "Submitted!" then "Next Task" button - annotator controls pace |
| 2026-02-04 | Side-by-side review layout | Original on left, corrections on right for easy comparison |
| 2026-02-04 | Copy-on-select for adjudication | Selecting annotation tab copies its data to resolution panel |
| 2026-02-03 | Monaco editor for template editing | VS Code-like experience with syntax highlighting, autocomplete |
| 2026-02-03 | Nunjucks as primary template format | Jinja-like syntax familiar to Python/Rust devs |
| 2026-02-03 | WASM-first interface design | Component interfaces designed as if WASM is primary consumer |
| 2026-02-03 | Y.js for real-time sync | CRDT-based, conflict-free collaboration like Google Docs |
| 2026-02-03 | Sandbox iframe with CSP | Secure template rendering with Content Security Policy |
| 2026-01-31 | Purple for interactive elements only | Professional, subtle aesthetic - navigation uses neutral highlights |
| 2026-01-31 | Zebra stripes with bg-muted/30 | Comfortable density, subtle alternating rows |
| 2026-01-31 | Semantic color borders for stat cards | Visual hierarchy without heavy purple usage |
| 2026-01-31 | Hover-to-expand sidebar | Better UX than requiring click to expand collapsed sidebar |
| 2026-01-31 | Role-based nav filtering | Hide admin links from non-admins for cleaner UX |
| 2026-01-31 | React Query cache for breadcrumbs | Dynamic entity names without extra API calls |
| 2026-01-31 | OKLCH color format | Perceptually uniform, better cross-theme consistency |
| 2026-01-31 | Tailwind v4 CSS-based config | No tailwind.config.js needed, simpler setup |
| 2026-01-31 | Pure black dark mode | OLED-friendly, high contrast design |
| 2026-01-29 | DevMode extension for auth bypass | Enables development without Auth0 configuration |
| 2026-01-29 | UUID binding via as_uuid() | Prefixed ID strings incompatible with PostgreSQL UUID columns |
| 2026-01-29 | PostgreSQL enum cast to text | SQLx cannot directly decode custom PostgreSQL enums |
| 2026-01-28 | Direct HTTP for Auth0 OIDC | openidconnect crate too complex; direct calls simpler |
| 2026-01-28 | HttpOnly cookies for tokens | More secure than localStorage, automatic refresh path restriction |
| 2026-01-28 | Tracing for audit logs | OpenTelemetry compatible, integrates with existing infrastructure |
| 2026-01-28 | UUID v7 for all IDs | Time-ordered UUIDs for better index performance and debugging |
| 2026-01-28 | Prefixed ID format | Human-readable IDs (user_xxx, team_xxx) improve debugging and logs |
| 2026-01-28 | RFC 7807 errors | Standard problem details format for consistent API error responses |
| 2026-01-28 | Per-operation error types | Fine-grained error handling without catch-all variants |
| 2026-01-28 | Hybrid monorepo structure | Supports parallel team development while keeping atomic commits |
| 2026-01-28 | Skip ML features for v1 | Focus team on core platform, AI engineers rejoin for v2 |
| 2026-01-28 | Auth0 for authentication | Enterprise SSO support, reduced custom auth code |
| 2026-01-28 | Nunjucks for layouts | Familiar Jinja syntax, works for Python/Rust devs generating templates |
