# Plan 04.1-04 Summary: Implement Breadcrumbs Component

**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** 2026-01-31

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Create useBreadcrumbs hook | 768f623 |
| 2 | Create Breadcrumbs component and integrate into layout | 768f623 |

## Deliverables

- **useBreadcrumbs.ts:**
  - Parses URL pathname into segments
  - Uses `routeLabels` for static segment names
  - Integrates with React Query cache for dynamic entity names
  - Falls back to shortened ID prefix (e.g., "PROJ...")

- **Breadcrumbs.tsx:**
  - Uses shadcn/ui Breadcrumb components
  - Slash separators between segments
  - All segments are links (including current)
  - Current page styled differently (BreadcrumbPage)

- **AppLayout.tsx:**
  - Breadcrumbs integrated in header after separator

## Verification

- [x] Breadcrumbs visible on every page
- [x] Slash separators between segments
- [x] Dynamic segments show entity name from cache
- [x] Home always shows as first segment
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors

## Notes

- Cache lookup tries multiple query key patterns for flexibility
- Entity names from `name`, `display_name`, or `title` fields
