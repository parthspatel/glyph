### WorkflowDesignerPage.tsx
Complete page component integrating all workflow designer features:

**Header:**
- Project name and status badge

- "Activate Project" button for draft projects

**Tab Navigation:**
- Visual - Visual canvas with drag-drop nodes
- YAML - YAML editor with bidirectional sync
- Data - Data source configuration (placeholder)
- Test - Launches test mode overlay

**Activation Flow:**
1. Click "Activate Project"
2. ActivationChecklist modal opens
3. User reviews and fixes blockers
4. Click "Activate" → API call
5. ActivationSuccess modal with next steps
6. Navigate to dashboard or stay

**Test Mode:**

### Route Integration

```

## Files Created
