# Phase 4.2: Style Phase 4 Screens - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Apply the Phase 3.1 design system (OKLCH tokens, royal purple, dark/light modes) to all existing Phase 4 UI screens — users, teams, profiles. Screens already exist and function; this phase makes them visually consistent with the established design system.

## Implementation Decisions

### Primary Accent Usage
- Purple reserved for interactive/action elements only — buttons, links, selections
- Navigation active states use subtle neutral highlights, not purple
- Headers and section titles remain clean without purple accents
- Professional, subtle aesthetic throughout

### Table and List Styling
- **Comfortable density** — balanced padding, easy to scan (not compact, not spacious)
- **Subtle zebra stripes** — alternating row backgrounds for differentiation
- **Selection indication** — purple checkbox + subtle purple row tint when selected for bulk actions

### Claude's Discretion
- Button styling approach (solid vs outline vs contextual)
- Badge and tag colors (semantic colors for states)
- Header and section divider styling
- QualityStats visualization (progress bars vs numeric vs minimal)
- SkillBadges visual style (pills vs tags vs chips)
- TeamTree hierarchy visualization (indented vs lines vs cards)
- Empty state approach (illustration vs text vs action-oriented)
- MemberList styling (table vs cards vs simple list)
- Modal dialog style (centered vs drawer vs context-dependent)
- Form field styling (outlined vs underlined vs filled)
- Button hierarchy placement in forms
- Validation error display pattern

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "Professional product, let's be subtle" — user emphasized restraint over flashy purple usage
- Purple should feel like a thoughtful accent, not dominant
- Consistency with Phase 3.1's OKLCH design tokens is the priority
