# Phase 5.2: Style Phase 5 Screens - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Apply the design system from Phase 3.1 to all Phase 5 screens (Projects list, Project detail, Project creation wizard, Project types, Data sources) for consistent theming. Migrate legacy CSS classes to shadcn/ui components and Tailwind design tokens.

## Implementation Decisions

### Project Table Layout
- Table layout (not cards) for projects list, consistent with Phase 4 users table
- Zebra stripes with `even:bg-muted/30` for alternating rows
- Columns: Name, Status, Project Type, Progress %, Owner, Created Date, Actions
- Checkbox column on left for bulk selection
- Purple highlight (`bg-primary/10` or similar) on selected rows
- Entire row clickable to navigate to project detail

### Project Status Visualization
- Semantic colors for statuses:
  - Draft: gray/muted
  - Active: green
  - Paused: yellow/amber
  - Archived: muted/gray
  - Completed: blue
- Pill badges with colored backgrounds (like Phase 4 skill badges)
- Text only in badges, no icons
- Progress percentage displayed as plain text (e.g., "45%"), no progress bars

### Project Detail Layout
- 75/25 split: main content 75%, sidebar 25%
- Multiple stat cards in a grid for key metrics (tasks, progress, quality)
- Project details displayed below the stat card grid
- Stat cards should use semantic border accents (consistent with Phase 4.2 pattern)
- Activity feed: timeline style with vertical connecting line
- Activity entries: compact/condensed height for minimal vertical space

### Empty & Loading States
- Follow existing project patterns throughout
- Empty states: Icon + text with CTA button (like ProjectTypesPage)
- Loading states: shadcn Skeleton with animated pulse
- Error states: Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Skeleton structure: Match existing approach (full structure skeletons)

### Claude's Discretion
- Sidebar action button styling (outline stacked, ghost with icons, or card list)
- Exact spacing and typography within stat cards
- Activity feed item internal layout
- Specific icon choices for empty states per screen

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- ProjectTypesPage (created in Phase 5.1) already uses design tokens correctly — use as reference
- Phase 4.2 established patterns to follow: zebra stripes, semantic colors, purple for interactive selection
- Migrate away from legacy CSS classes (`page-container`, `btn btn-primary`, `error-banner`) to shadcn/ui + Tailwind tokens
