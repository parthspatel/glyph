### Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 2477c86 | feat(05.2-01): style projects list with design tokens |
| de90c1a | feat(05.2-02): style project detail with design tokens |
| d9e882f | feat(05.2-03): style project form with design tokens |

### Human Verification Required

1. **Visual Consistency Check** - Navigate Projects list, detail, and form pages; verify purple theme and contrast in light/dark mode
2. **Responsive Layout** - Resize browser; 75/25 layout should collapse gracefully on mobile
3. **Interactive States** - Hover over rows, click checkboxes, expand accordions; verify smooth transitions

## Summary

Phase 5.2 has successfully achieved its goal of applying design tokens from Phase 3.1 to all Phase 5 UI screens.

**Key accomplishments:**
- Zebra striping pattern matching UserTable from Phase 4.2
- Semantic status colors (draft=gray, active=green, paused=amber, completed=blue)
- Purple selection state for table rows
- Stat cards with semantic border accents
- Timeline-style activity feed
- shadcn Button and Skeleton components throughout
- Proper loading, empty, and error states
