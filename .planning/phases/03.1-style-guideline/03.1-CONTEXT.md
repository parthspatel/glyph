# Phase 3.1: Style Guideline - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Build a comprehensive design system for Glyph with dark/light mode support and royal purple as the key brand color. This includes design tokens, color palette, theming infrastructure, and component styling patterns. Does NOT include building new UI components — only the styling foundation that existing and future components will use.

## Implementation Decisions

### Color Palette Structure
- Primary brand color: Vibrant mid-purple (~#7C3AED range)
- 10-shade scale for each color (50-900, Tailwind pattern)
- Semantic colors: Standard conventions (green success, yellow warning, red error, blue info)
- Neutral grays: Warm undertone (slight brown/tan) for softer feel
- Dark mode: Same purple primary, no adaptation needed
- Dark mode surfaces: Pure black backgrounds (#000 or near-black), OLED-friendly

### Interactive States
- Hover: Lighten/darken background (subtle surface change)
- Active/Pressed: Shade shift darker (e.g., purple-600 → purple-700)
- Focus: Ring/outline with purple-400 and offset (accessibility)
- Disabled: 50% opacity + cursor change

### Theme Switching Behavior
- Initial theme: System preference (OS dark/light setting)
- User override: Allowed, user can manually switch
- Persistence: LocalStorage for immediate load, sync to user profile when logged in
- Transitions: None — instant switch, no animation
- Toggle location: Settings page only (not prominent in header)

### Typography & Spacing
- Font family: Inter
- Type scale: Tailwind defaults (xs, sm, base, lg, xl, 2xl, etc.)
- Spacing system: Tailwind defaults (0.25rem/4px increments)

### Component Styling Patterns
- CSS approach: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- shadcn/ui base theme: Stone (warm neutrals, matches warm gray decision)
- Customization depth: Minimal — use shadcn defaults, swap primary to purple
- Border radius: Subtle (4-6px) — Linear-like, professional, clean

### Claude's Discretion
- Font weights: Recommend standard 3 weights (400, 500, 600)
- Exact purple hex values within the vibrant mid-purple range
- Shadow definitions for elevation
- Specific token naming conventions

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I like Linear" — Clean, restrained, professional aesthetic with subtle depth
- Warm grays + vibrant purple creates approachable but professional feel
- Pure black dark mode surfaces for OLED efficiency and high contrast
- Instant theme switching (no transition animations)
