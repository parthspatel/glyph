# Plan 05.1-02 Summary: Create Project Types admin page with navigation

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

## What Was Built

Created the Project Types admin page allowing administrators to view and manage project type templates, with protected route and sidebar navigation.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Create ProjectTypesPage component | `58adbd4` | `ProjectTypesPage.tsx` |
| 2 | Add route and navigation item | `a4e9445` | `App.tsx`, `navigation.ts` |

## Key Changes

### ProjectTypesPage.tsx (219 lines)
- Page header with Layers icon and "Create Type" button
- Table with columns: Name, Description, Difficulty, Type (System/Custom), Created, Actions
- Loading state with skeleton components
- Empty state when no project types exist
- Edit and Delete actions (Delete disabled for system types)
- Follows design system: semantic colors, zebra stripes, hover states

### App.tsx
- Added import for ProjectTypesPage
- Added `/admin/project-types` route inside admin ProtectedRoute block

### navigation.ts
- Added Layers icon import
- Added nav item: `{ href: "/admin/project-types", label: "Project Types", icon: Layers, roles: ["admin"] }`

## Verification

- Admin users see "Project Types" in sidebar navigation
- Non-admin users do not see the nav item
- Route is protected by admin role
- Page uses useProjectTypes hook for data fetching
- TypeScript compiles without errors

## Deviations

None.
