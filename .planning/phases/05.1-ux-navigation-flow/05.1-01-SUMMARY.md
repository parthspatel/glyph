# Plan 05.1-01 Summary: Fix breadcrumb cache lookup and add route labels

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** ~5 minutes

## What Was Built

Fixed breadcrumb cache lookup to correctly resolve project names from React Query cache, and added missing route labels for project-related paths.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fix breadcrumb cache key pattern matching | `4fcd26f` | `useBreadcrumbs.ts` |
| 2 | Add missing route labels for project paths | `a262e48` | `navigation.ts` |

## Key Changes

### useBreadcrumbs.ts
- Added `['projects', 'detail', id]` pattern to match useProject query key structure
- Added `['team', 'detail', id]` pattern for consistency
- Breadcrumbs now correctly resolve entity names from React Query cache

### navigation.ts
- Added `"project-types": "Project Types"` label
- Added `"sources": "Data Sources"` label
- Added `"overview": "Overview"` label

## Verification

- Breadcrumbs display project names (not IDs) when project data is cached
- Route labels are friendly for all project-related paths
- No regression in existing breadcrumb functionality

## Deviations

None.
