# Plan 05.1-03 Summary: Add project-scoped sidebar navigation

**Status:** Complete
**Duration:** ~3 minutes

## What Was Built

Added a project-scoped navigation section to the sidebar that appears when viewing any project page, providing quick access to project-specific actions.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Files |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add project-scoped sidebar section | `bf4c8e6` | `AppSidebar.tsx` |
| 2 | Extract project nav items to configuration | (same commit) | `AppSidebar.tsx` |

## Key Changes

### AppSidebar.tsx
- Added `useParams` import from react-router-dom
- Added `SidebarGroupLabel` import from sidebar components
- Added `FileText`, `Settings`, `ClipboardList` icons from lucide-react
- Created `projectNavItems` configuration array for maintainability
- Added `isProjectContext` detection based on URL params
- Added conditional `SidebarGroup` with "Project" label
- Maps over projectNavItems for Overview, Settings, Tasks links
- Active state styling matches main nav (purple border, bg-accent)

## Verification

- Navigate to /projects - no project section in sidebar
- Navigate to /projects/new - no project section (new project has no ID)
- Navigate to /projects/:projectId - project section appears
- Project section shows: Overview, Settings, Tasks
- Active item has purple left border and bold text
- Navigating between project pages updates active state
- Navigating away from project removes project section
- Hover-to-expand works with project section

## Deviations

None - both tasks combined into single commit since Task 2 was a refactor of Task 1.
